                  <br>Tierra Narrative (TN) is a multimedia storytelling production house dedicated to the curation and creation of new narratives through transnational cultural production between the Central American diaspora and our homelands.<br>
                  <br>In 2018, we produced our first short film, Isabel, written and directed by co-founder Kenia R. Guillen, which has screened at NYU, Icaro Film Festival, and KQED Arts. Apart from our film work, we hope to create more opportunities through our curation and programming, where we can be found and find others, while supporting narratives that better imagine our collective futures. <br>
                  <br>TN has programmed film screenings, curated poetry readings, and hosted conversations with the Hemispheric Institute of Performance & Politics, Open Society Foundations, Allied Media Conference, The People’s Forum, and Xamanil Kaqchikel Jay–– addressing subjects such as migration, displacement, Indigeneity, activism, and our relationship to other diasporic populations. <br>
                  <br>During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have explored ways to use virtual programming as a source of mutual aid and community care, raising more than 10k to support BIPOC and undocumented folk, land defenders, and others affected by systemic violence in the New York metropolitan area, Guatemala and Mexico. We intend to continue these practices of care moving forward.<br>

                  <b>Kenia R. Guillen</b> (b. 1994, El Salvador) is a filmmaker and interdisciplinary artist based in New York. Her cinematic practice is in conversation with the wounds of migration; creating with the intention to find processes of healing communally. Inspired by myths and legends, she’s interested in the power of personal memory as an archive, how to write rural life and peoples into cinematic memory, and how to honor the mystical and supernatural as reality. Her work has been exhibited in spaces such as Open Society Foundations, Galería de La Raza, El Museo de Los Sures, Tragame Luz Festival, and Icaro Film Festival. IG: @guillenken
