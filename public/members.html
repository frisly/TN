                <b>Kenia R. Guillen</b> (b. 1994, El Salvador) is a filmmaker and interdisciplinary artist based in New York. Her cinematic practice is in conversation with the wounds of migration; creating with the intention to find processes of healing. Inspired by myths and legends, she’s interested in the power of personal memory as an archive, how to write rural life and peoples into cinematic memory, and how to honor the mystical and supernatural as reality. Her work has been exhibited in spaces such as Open Society Foundations, Galería de La Raza, El Museo de Los Sures, Tragame Luz Festival, Icaro Film Festival.

Génesis is currently in pre-production of their first narrative short film, DÓLAR, a satirical film about a young Kaqchikel influencer from Chimaltenango, Guatemala who struggles to maintain her perfect image online and in real life. @gmabaj
